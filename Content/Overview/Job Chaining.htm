        <h1>Job Chaining</h1>
        <p>Job Chaining allows you to link jobs so that they run one directly after another. For example, you can set up a VM backup job, which saves backups locally and then starts a&#160;<a href="C:\display\NH\Creating+Backup+Copy+Jobs">Backup Copy job</a>, which copies the newly created backups to Amazon cloud.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Job+Chaining/Job Chaining.png" alt="Running Backup Copy after Backup" class="img_2" />
            <br />You can link any type of jobs together – backup, backup copy, replication and recovery – and add any number of jobs to the chain. For instance, you can set up a series of backup jobs that trigger one another in the order of priority, or set up a series of Backup Copy jobs, which first send weekly backups to a DR repository and then send monthly&#160;backups to Amazon cloud&#160;for archiving.</p>
