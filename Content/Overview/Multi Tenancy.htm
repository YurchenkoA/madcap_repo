        <h1>Multi-Tenancy</h1>
        <p>Multi-tenancy enables you to create and manage up to 1,000 isolated tenants within a single copy of the product. Tenants can represent business units, branch offices, departments, customers, and any other entities.</p>

        </p>
        <p>In Multi-tenant mode, each tenant can access their own environment through a self-service portal, and perform all data protection and recovery tasks. At the same time, tenants are isolated from each other and cannot access the environment and jobs of other tenants.</p>
        <p>With Multi-tenancy, you can:</p>
