        <h1>EMC DD Boost</h1>
        <p>The&#160;Dell/EMC Data Domain Boost technology allows for the reduction of storage consumption by up to 17X, greatly accelerating the VM backup process. The aggregate quantity of business data produced has drastically increased in recent years, which results in two major problems for modern companies. The first is the amount of storage space that backups occupy, and the second is the significant load on the production network created by backup operations, especially if they are run during business hours.</p>
        <p>NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication and Dell/EMC Data Domain Boost offer a combined solution for both of these challenges. By using NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication along with source-side deduplication of Dell/EMC Data Domain Boost, you can perform VM backups 50% faster while reducing the size of your backups by up to 94%. This means that you can offload your network and save storage space at the same time.</p>
