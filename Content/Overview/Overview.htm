        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication offers a complete solution - backup, replication, failover, backup to the cloud, backup copy, backup size reduction, screenshot verification, and site recovery for virtualized, cloud, and physical environments - all in one convenient web interface.</p>
        <p>&#160;<img src="../Resources/Images/Overview/Overview.png" /></p>
        <p>The product provides image-based, application-aware, incremental backup and replication. You can easily schedule jobs using the <MadCap:xref href="Calendar.htm">Calendar</MadCap:xref> in the product's web interface and save up to 1,000 recovery points for each backup, rotating them on a GFS basis. You can also protect your VMs and instances more efficiently by taking advantage of Changed Block Tracking (for VMware), Resilient Change Tracking (for Hyper-V), or Changed Regions Tracking (for Nutanix), LAN-Free Data Transfer, and Network Acceleration.</p>
        <p>The solution includes an advanced disaster recovery (DR) functionality. It allows you to automate and orchestrate DR activities across multiple sites. Build advanced <MadCap:xref href="Site Recovery.htm">Site Recovery</MadCap:xref> workflows to failover an entire site in just a few clicks, perform non-disruptive recoverability testing, and make sure you have a workable DR plan in place to help minimize downtime and prevent loss of revenue or data.</p>
        <p>NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication allows you to simplify data protection management through the automation of core tasks such as backup, replication, and backup copy. Instead of tracking every change in your environment and manually adding VMs or physical machines to jobs, you can set up <a href="Policy Based Data Protection.htm">policies</a> based on a VM/physical machine name, tag, size, location, power state, configuration, or other parameters. NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication can regularly scan your infrastructure and automatically protect VMs, physical machines, and EC2 instances that match policy rules.</p>
