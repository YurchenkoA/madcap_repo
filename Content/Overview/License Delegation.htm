        <h1>License Delegation</h1>
        <p>In Multi-tenant mode, NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication enables you to create multiple isolated tenants in a single copy of the product. The tenants can represent branch offices/departments in enterprise environments or clients in&#160;<a href="https://www.nakivo.com/partner/cloud-provider-program/">Cloud Provider</a>&#160;environments.</p>
        <p>Since tenants are isolated and need to have a limit as to how many licenses each of them can use, NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication has provided the License Delegation feature. In Multi-tenant mode, a Master Admin (tenant manager) can install one multi-socket license in the product and then assign—or delegate—a specific number of licenses to each tenant. For example, the Master Admin can install a 20-socket license in the Multi-tenant mode of NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication, and assign 3 licenses to Tenant A, 2 licenses to Tenant B, and 4 licenses to Tenant C, and let 11 licenses remain unused.</p>

        </p>
        <p>At any moment, the Master Admin can redistribute licenses: revoke any number of licenses from any tenant, which will return them to the Master License Pool, and add licenses to another tenant.</p>
        <p>The License Delegation feature makes license management simple and manageable in large and distributed environments.</p>
