        <h1>Policy-Based Data Protection</h1>
        <p>Policy-Based Data Protection relieves you of the need to chase new VMs or changes in your infrastructure. Once a policy is created, all the matching VMs are protected automatically. Whenever a VM's status changes, the policy recognizes this change and excludes or adds the VM to jobs accordingly.&#160;The feature is designed to reduce complexity and add more flexibility to data protection processes such as backup, replication, or backup copy. You can set rules based on the VM name, tag, size, location, VM configuration, power state, or any combination of these parameters.&#160;A newly-created VM or instance is automatically added to data protection jobs if they match your policy rules; you don't have to keep track of all the changes in your infrastructure or manually manage data protection for new VMs. You can add as many new VMs and instances as you need– NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication can automatically protect all of them for you, as long as you have policy-based jobs in place.</p>
        <p>This functionality can be a great time-saver if your virtualized infrastructure is actively expanding, includes numerous VMs and instances, or has a complex multilayer architecture. The Policy-Based Data Protection feature contributes greatly to the overall usability of NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication, making it an even more efficient data protection tool.&#160;Policies can be created for VM backup, replication, and backup copy jobs in just a few steps. Simply select the criteria (e.g., a VM's name, size, tag, etc.), enter the necessary search parameters, and have all the matching items included in the job automatically. For instance, you can choose to back up all VMware VMs tagged "Accounting" which exceed100 GB in size and have more than 2 GB of allocated RAM. Once the policy has been created, NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication recognizes newly added VMs or instances with the same characteristics and automatically includes them into the existing job.</p>
