        <h1>Site Recovery</h1>
        <p>With&#160;<a href="C:\display\NH\Creating+Site+Recovery+Job">Site Recovery Jobs</a>&#160;introduced, NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication allows you to automate the execution of one or more Actions. An Action refers to a single task that can be included in a Site Recovery Job. Refer to&#160;<a href="C:\display\NH\Site+Recovery+Job+Wizard:+Actions">Site Recovery Job Wizard: Actions</a>&#160;for the list of available actions.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Special Actions that are used in recovering your IT environment with a Site Recovery Job are Failover and Failback:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_2"><b>Failover</b>&#160;switches workloads from the primary location to a secondary recovery location. With Failover action, you can temporarily suspend workloads on the primary location, and start them from the recovery location.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_2"><b>Failback</b>&#160;is the process of synchronizing data that has changed since Failover finished, back to the primary location. With Failback action, you can stop workloads on the secondary location and switch them back to the primary location.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Failover and Failback actions are applicable to replicas, and switch replica states from&#160;<cite>Failover</cite>&#160;to&#160;<cite>Normal</cite>&#160;correspondingly. The Site Recovery Job can be executed in one of the following modes:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_2"><b>Test mode</b>&#160;is designed to verify the Site Recovery Job workflow and results. You can execute a Site Recovery Job in the test mode on demand or on schedule. Refer to&#160;<a href="file:///C:/display/NH/Running+Site+Recovery+Job#RunningSiteRecoveryJob-RunningSiteRecoveryJobinTestMode">Running Site Recovery Job in Test Mode</a>&#160;for details.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_2"><b>Production mode</b>&#160;is designed to recover the environment from a disaster. You can execute a Site Recovery Job in the production mode on demand only. Refer to&#160;<a href="file:///C:/display/NH/Running+Site+Recovery+Job#RunningSiteRecoveryJob-RunningSiteRecoveryJobinProductionMode">Running Site Recovery Job in Production mode</a>&#160;for details.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When the Site Recovery Job is run in the production mode, Failover may be either of the following types:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_2"><b>Planned failover</b>&#160;is designed to achieve zero data loss when disaster happens. The application will sync replica data with the source VM before switching workloads to the replica.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_2"><b>Emergency failover</b>&#160;is designed to minimize downtime. The application will switch workloads from the source VM to the replica immediately.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
