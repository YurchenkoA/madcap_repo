        <h2>Licensing Types</h2>
        <p>NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication offers the following licensing types:</p>
        <h3>Perpetual Licensing</h3>
        <p>For VMware, Hyper-V, and Nutanix AHV infrastructures, NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication can be licensed on a per-socket basis. A license is required for each socket on a host where you plan to back up or replicate VMs. Licenses are required only for the source side of backup and replication, that is, you do not need to license target servers for your replicas or the servers on which you want to recover VMs.&#160;One year of Standard Support is included with perpetual licenses.</p>
        <p>Perpetual licenses can also be purchased for backing up and restoring Oracle databases (Enterprise Plus edition only). A license is required for every Oracle database you plan to back up and restore.&#160;&#160;</p>
        <h3>Per-workload Subscription Licensing</h3>
        <p>NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication can be licensed on a per-workload basis. A workload can be a VMware VM, Microsoft Hyper-V VM, Nutanix AHV VM, physical machine (server or workstation), Oracle database (Enterprise Plus edition only), or AWS EC2 instance that you plan to back up or replicate. Regardless of the type, each item is counted as one workload. Licenses are required only for the source side of backup and replication, that is, you do not need to license target servers for your replicas or the servers on which you want to recover workloads.&#160;Subscription licenses include 24/7 Support.</p>
        <h3>Subscription Licensing for Microsoft 365</h3>
        <p>Backup and Recovery for Microsoft 365 is licensed on a per-user, per-month basis. The license can be purchased together with any edition (Basic, Pro Essentials, Enterprise Essentials, Pro, Enterprise, or Enterprise Plus) and combined with any license type (Perpetual or Subscription). Subscription licenses for Backup and Recovery for Microsoft 365 include 24/7 Support. The minimum number of licenses per order is 10.</p>
        <p class="p_1">When combined with a perpetual license, the support end date of the perpetual license and subscription license for Backup and Recovery for Microsoft 365 must be aligned. The support level may be Standard for perpetual sockets and 24/7 for Microsoft 365 Subscription. Optionally, the support level for perpetual sockets can be upgraded to 24/7 Support.</p>
