        <h1>Universal Object Recovery</h1>
        <p>The Universal Object Recovery feature allows you to recover any object in the infrastructure – whatever the application or file system – in a matter of minutes by mounting the appropriate backup to a VM or physical machine and then recovering the necessary data using the native application tools.</p>
        <p>Universal Object Recovery provides multiple recovery options, increases the flexibility of the recovery process, and saves a significant amount of time.</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_2">Versatility – with Universal Object Recovery, you are not limited to certain applications or file systems: you can recover any object at any time (provided you have a recent backup). Moreover, the feature allows you to recover individual objects back to the source, to another VM or instance, or even to a physical machine.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_2">Lower Overhead – Universal Object Recovery lets you restore individual objects without having to recover the entire VM or physical machine. Thus, the feature eliminates the complexity of full machine recovery, saving you time that can be better used for other important tasks.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_2">Faster Recovery – recovering an entire machine from a deduplicated and compressed backup takes time, affecting your ability to meet your RTOs. With Universal Object Recovery, you can instantly mount disks from a backup, decreasing recovery time and ensuring minimal interruptions in your business operations.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can use NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication to recover application objects in a few simple steps: just open the Universal Object Recovery Wizard and select the appropriate recovery point. Once you choose the disks you wish to be mounted, NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication attaches said disks to the specified VM or physical machine. All you need to do after the mount is log into the corresponding VM or physical machine and use native application tools to recover the data.</p>
