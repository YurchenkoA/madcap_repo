        <h1>Disaster Recovery</h1>
        <p class="p_3"><span class="span_2">Disaster Recovery (DR) is a practice intended to support an organization's ability to remain fully operational after an emergency event.&#160;DR serves to limit risks by getting an organization's infrastructure to run as close to normal as possible after an abrupt intermission.&#160;NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication allows you to address all major DR planning points by creating automated DR workflows for VMware, Microsoft Hyper-V, Nutanix AHV and AWS EC2 environments. The application&#160;allows you to protect VMs running within a cluster, replicate VMs, and fail over to replicas.&#160;</span>
        </p>
        <p class="p_3"><span class="span_2">When utilizing Site Recovery, you can include up to 200 actions&#160;to a single job, including failover, failback, start/stop VMs and instances, run/stop jobs, run script, attach or detach repository, send email, wait, and check condition. By arranging actions and conditions into one automated algorithm, you can create Site Recovery jobs of any complexity level.</span>
