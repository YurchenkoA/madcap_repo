        <h1>Replication From Backup</h1>
        <p>The Replication From Backup feature allows for offloading the production environment by replicating VMs directly from backups.</p>

        <p>Setting up a replication from backup job for VMware and Hyper-V environments is no more time-consuming than setting up a traditional replication job. Once you launch a new replication job wizard and select VM backup as the source, NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication proceeds to read the data from the repository and injects it into the replica.&#160;</p>
