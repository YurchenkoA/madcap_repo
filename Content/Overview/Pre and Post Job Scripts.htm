        <h1>Pre and Post Job Scripts</h1>

        <p>By running your pre- and post- job scripts, you can do just about anything: start custom pre-freeze and post-thaw scripts on Linux systems to create&#160;<a href="C:\display\NH\Application+and+Database+Support">application-aware VM backups</a>&#160;and replicas, wake servers, establish connections, mount volumes, start and stop services, send commands to 3rd-party reporting, monitoring and automation tools, and so on.</p>
