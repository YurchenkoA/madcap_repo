        <p>A common misconception among SaaS users is that data stored in the cloud is safe and that it is not necessary to back it up. However, under Microsoft’s “shared responsibility model”, Microsoft is responsible for reliable uptime and the physical and virtual infrastructure. Beyond simple geo-redundancy – which is not the same as a backup – ensuring data safety is the responsibility of users. To address this gap, NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication offers Microsoft 365 Backup &amp; Recovery to ensure that data is accessible and recoverable at all times.</p>
        <p>With Microsoft 365 Backup &amp; Recovery, you can back up entire Microsoft 365 accounts, individual mailboxes hosted in Exchange Online, and OneDrive instances. By backing up Microsoft 365 application data, you ensure that if data loss occurs, the necessary items can be easily recovered to the original or a custom location.</p>
