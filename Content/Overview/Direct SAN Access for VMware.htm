        <h1>Direct SAN Access for VMware</h1>
        <p>If your VMs are located on a Fiber Channel or iSCSI Storage Area Network (SAN) device, NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication can use direct SAN access for data retrieval. Using this storage access mode can significantly increase the speed of backup and replication&#160;while decreasing the load on your production network.</p>

        </p>
        <p>NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication relies on the&#160;VMware VDDK library that provides SAN support&#160;and&#160;does not make any write/modification operations on the SAN LUNs. That is to say, the product&#160;will not compromise data integrity or interfere with the data of running VMs on your SAN datastores.</p>
        <p>For information about Transporter deployment requirements as well as recommendations on&#160;setting up the SAN access, refer to&#160;<a href="C:\display\KB\Transporter+Deployment+for+SAN+Access">Transporter Deployment for SAN Access</a>.</p>
