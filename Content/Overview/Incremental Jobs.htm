                <p class="p_2">When an&#160;<b>incremental with full backups</b>&#160;Backup Repository is utilized as a destination, NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication performs a full backup on the first backup job run. Consequently, NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication runs incremental backups and periodically creates full backups according to the specified settings. Every VM backed up to said Backup Repository will produce full backup files and incremental backup files.</p>

        <h2>Replication Jobs</h2>
        <p>Replication jobs in NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication are forever incremental. This means that after the initial full replication, all subsequent job runs will send only changed data (increments) to the replica. This approach reduces the replication time and network load.&#160;For example, if NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication determines that the amount of changed data on a 100 GB VM constitutes just 1 MB, only 1 MB of data will be transferred to the replica VM.</p>
