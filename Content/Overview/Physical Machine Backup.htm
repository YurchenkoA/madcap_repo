        <h2>Physical Machine Backup Features</h2>
        <p>NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication&#160;performs incremental backup jobs using a proprietary change tracking method which allows you to save time and storage resources as it transfers only changed blocks of data to the backup repository. To protect your backups, the product utilizes AES 256-bit encryption to transform data into an unreadable ciphertext&#160;to prevent unauthorized&#160;access to it. To improve backup performance, you can enable network acceleration to speed up data transfer over LAN and WAN networks.&#160;The product also allows you to recover files and application objects as well as to recover a physical machine&#160;to VMware and Microsoft Hyper-V virtual machines. This way, you can easily perform the migration of physical workloads to virtual environments.&#160;</p>
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>To ensure your physical machines are successfully backed up and recovered, you need to <a href="C:\display\NH\Adding+Physical+Machines">add a new physical machine</a> to the product inventory first. Support for physical machines is done via the Physical Machine Agent (PMA) deployed in the physical machine OS. Communication between the Director and PMA is secured by means of a Certificate and Pre-shared Key generated by the Director and then injected into the PMA. During a physical machine discovery, NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication checks to see if the PMA is already installed on the physical machine. If the PMA is detected, the product adds the physical machine to the inventory.&#160;If the PMA is outdated, it is automatically updated.&#160;If the PMA or a Transporter is not detected, the product:</p>

                <p class="p_2">Manual installation of the PMA is not supported.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The installation path is the same as the one used for the Transporter on the corresponding OS.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The communication ports are the same as those used for the Transporter on the corresponding OS.</p>

        <p>Creating a physical machine backup job is a five-step process:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <li class="li_1">

            </li>
            <li class="li_1">

            </li>
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_2"><a href="C:\display\NH\Backup+Job+Wizard+for+Physical+Machine:+Schedule">Set the backup job schedule</a>.</p>
            </li>

                <p class="p_2"><a href="C:\display\NH\Backup+Job+Wizard+for+Physical+Machine:+Retention">Specify your retention policy</a>.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_2"><a href="C:\display\NH\Backup+Job+Wizard+for+Physical+Machine:+Options">Configure the backup job options</a>.&#160;</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once the physical machine backup job has started, NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication captures the necessary data blocks from the physical machine and sends them to the selected backup repository for storage. The backed up data then can be accessed and recovered whenever needed.&#160;</p>
