        <h2><a name="Deployme"></a>Deployment Scenario</h2>
        <p>In this scenario, tenant VMs are running and replicated locally at the remote sites.</p>
        <p><b>Example</b>
        </p>
        <p>An Enterprise has two branch offices running VMware virtual infrastructure. The IT manager located at the headquarters is responsible for the Enterprise data protection and needs to replicate business critical VMs locally at the branch offices for high availability.</p>
        <h2><a name="Deployme2"></a>Deployment Diagram</h2>
        <p>The deployment diagram for the above scenario is as follows:</p>
        <p class="p_112">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/02. Deployment/Local Replication at Remote.jpg" class="img_26" />
        </p>
        <h2><a name="Deployme3"></a>Deployment Steps</h2>
        <p>To deploy the above scenario, perform the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Install the Director in multi-tenant mode at the master site.</li>
            <li>Install at least one Transporter at each remote site.</li>
            <li>For each tenant, prepare a separate folder at the remote site for creating a Backup Repository. </li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="Connecti"></a>Connections</h2>
        <p>The implementation of the above scenario requires that the following connections be available:</p>
