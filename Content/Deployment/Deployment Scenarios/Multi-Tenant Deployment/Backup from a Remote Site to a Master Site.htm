        <h2><a name="Deployme"></a>Deployment Scenario</h2>
        <p>In this scenario, tenant VMs are running at remote sites and are backed up to a single master site.</p>
        <p><b>Example</b>
        </p>
        <p>A service provider needs to back up customers' VMs to the service provider’s datacenter so that the customers don’t see each other’s backups and can recover their own files and emails through a self-service interface.</p>
        <h2><a name="Deployme2"></a>Deployment Diagram</h2>
        <p>The deployment diagram for the above scenario is as follows:</p>
        <p class="p_112">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/02. Deployment/Backup from a Remote Site.jpg" class="img_22" />
        </p>
        <h2><a name="Deployme3"></a>Deployment Steps</h2>
        <p>To deploy the above scenario, perform the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Install the Director in multi-tenant mode at the master site.</li>
            <li>Install at least one Transporter at the master site.</li>
            <li>Install at least one Transporter at each remote site.</li>
            <li>For each tenant, prepare a separate folder at the master site for creating separate Backup Repositories. </li>
        </ol>
        <h2><a name="Connecti"></a>Connections</h2>
        <p class="p_50">The implementation of the above scenario requires that the following connections be available:</p>
