        <h1>Multi-Tenant Deployment</h1>
        <p>Multi-tenancy allows you to create multiple isolated tenants within a single product deployment and manage them from a single pane of glass. In the Multi-Tenant mode, tenants can access the self-service portal to offload backup, replication, and recovery tasks from the service provider. </p>
