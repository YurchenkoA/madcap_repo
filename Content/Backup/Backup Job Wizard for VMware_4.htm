            <li class="li_1">
                <p>If you cannot find a VM or a container, try the following: </p>

                    <li class="li_1">
                        <p>Make sure that the corresponding vCenter or ESXi host has been&#160;<a href="C:\display\NH\Adding+Installed+Transporters" class="Hyperlink">added to the inventory</a>. &#160;</p>

            <li class="li_1">
                <p>By adding a VMware container to the job, you ensure that important VMs are always protected. If you add a VMware container to the job: </p>
                <ul class="ul_2">
                    <li class="li_1">
                        <p>All VMs currently available in the selected container will be backed up.</p>

                        <p>All new VMs that are created in (or moved to) the container in the future will be automatically added to the job and backed up.</p>

                <p>The order in which VMs are backed up is important if the Transporter performing the backup cannot process all VMs of the job simultaneously – either because the Transporter is processing other jobs at the same time or because the number of VM disks in the job exceeds the Transporter’s maximum Load specified during the Transporter creation.&#160;</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li_1">
                <p>VMs marked as primary are protected by <a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere/fault-tolerance.html" class="Hyperlink">VMware Fault Tolerance</a>. Disabled VMs are Fault Tolerance shadow VMs.</p>
