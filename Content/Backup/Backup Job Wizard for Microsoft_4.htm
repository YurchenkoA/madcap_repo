        <h1>Backup Job Wizard for Microsoft 365: Source</h1>
        <p>On the <span class="Strong">Source</span> page of the wizard, add the Microsoft 365 account(s) or separate OneDrives and mailboxes hosted in Exchange Outline to your backup job. Proceed as follows:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <li class="li_1">
                <p>In the left pane of the page, select the items you want to back up. If you select a Microsoft 365 account, all mailboxes and OneDrive instances contained in that account are added to the backup job. To quickly find an item, use the <span class="Strong">Search</span> functionality; you can enter a part of or the entire name of the item.<br />Selected items are displayed in the right pane. You can remove items from the pane if necessary or change the priority of the item by dragging and dropping it in the required position. The priority determines the order in which the item will be processed during the job run.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="NormalWeb_1">
                <p>Click <span class="Strong">Next </span>to confirm the selection and go to the next page of the wizard.<br /><br /><img src="../Resources/Images/Backup+Job+Wizard+for+Microsoft+365_+Source/Backup Job Wizard for Microsoft_4.png" class="img_54" /></p>
