                        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
                            <li class="li_1">
                                <p>If items were selected in alternate views, a dialog box opens warning you that switching to the <span class="Strong">Policy</span> view will reset your current selection. Click <span class="Strong">Switch View</span> to confirm switching to the <span class="Strong">Policy</span> view.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>Make sure that at least one item matches the available set of policy rules. Refer to <a href="C:\display\NH\Managing+Policy+Rules" class="Hyperlink">Managing Policy Rules</a> for details.</p>
                            </li>

            <li class="li_1">
                <p>Click <span class="Strong">Next</span> to confirm adding selected items to the backup copy job.</p>

        <p>Notes:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <li class="li_1">
                <p>If you add a container – a group, job, or a backup repository – to the backup copy job, the following actions will occur: </p>
                <ul class="ul_2">
                    <li class="li_1">
                        <p>All backups currently available in the selected container will be backed up.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="li_1">
                        <p>All new backups that are created in (or moved to) the container in the future will be automatically added to the job and backed up.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="li_1">
                <p>The order in which backups are copied is important if the Transporter that is running the job cannot process all items simultaneously: either because the Transporter is processing other tasks at the same time or because the number of backups in the job exceeds the Transporter’s Maximum Load specified during the Transporter creation.</p>
            </li>
