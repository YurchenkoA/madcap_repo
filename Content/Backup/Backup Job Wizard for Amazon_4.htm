                        <p><span class="Strong">AWS Accounts</span>: If chosen, the inventory tree opens in the left pane and shows you Amazon EC2 accounts along with their Regions and available Instances. Proceed as follows: </p>
                        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
                            <li class="li_1">
                                <p>Optionally, filter the inventory tree by entering a string to the <span class="Strong">Search</span> box. You can enter a part or the entire item name.</p>
                            </li>

                                <p>The selected items appear in the right pane of the page. If necessary, reorder the selected items by dragging an Instance, Region, or Account to a new position.

        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <li class="li_1">
                <p>If you cannot find an&#160;Instance, try the following: </p>
                <ul class="ul_2">
                    <li class="li_1">
                        <p>Make sure that an appropriate Amazon account (that which was used to create the Instance) is added to the&#160;<a href="C:\display\NH\Inventory" class="Hyperlink">inventory</a>. &#160;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="li_1">

            </li>
            <li class="li_1">
                <p>If you add a Region or an Account&#160;to the job, the following will occur: </p>
                <ul class="ul_2">
                    <li class="li_1">
                        <p>&#160;All Instances currently available in the selected Region/Account&#160;will be backed up by the job.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="li_1">
                        <p>All new instances&#160;that are created in (or moved to) the Region/Account&#160;in the future will be automatically added to the backup job and backed up.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li class="li_1">
                <p>The order in which Instances are backed is important if the Transporter performing the backup cannot process all Instances of the job simultaneously – either because the Transporter is loaded or because the number of disks in the job exceeds the Transporter’s maximum load specified during the Transporter’s creation.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li_1">
                <p>To back up Instances in a Region, at least one&#160;<a href="C:\display\NH\Transporter" class="Hyperlink">Transporter&#160;</a>must be&#160;<a href="C:\display\NH\Installing+NAKIVO+Backup+and+Replication" class="Hyperlink">installed&#160;</a>in that region. If there are no Transporters in a particular Region, the product will suggest that you automatically install a Transporter with the default options.</p>
