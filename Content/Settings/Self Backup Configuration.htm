        <h1>Self-Backup Configuration</h1>
        <p>The self-backup feature allows you to automatically protect configuration settings of your NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication instance. For more information, refer to&#160;<a href="C:\display\NH\Self-Backup+Feature">Self-Backup Feature</a>.</p>
        <p>Note</p>
        <p>Self-backup is not supported for the multi-tenant configuration.</p>

        <p>To access self-backup options, follow the steps below:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <li class="li_1">
                <p>Click&#160;<b>Settings</b>&#160;in the left pane of NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication.</p>

        <h2>Setting Up Self-Backup Destination</h2>
        <p>To configure a self-backup destination, follow the steps below:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <li>
                <p>Select <b>Back up system configuration to all repositories</b> to enable all repositories in the list of repositories where system configuration will be backed up. If deselected, you can remove specific repositories from the list.</p>
                <p>Important</p>
                <p>Backing up your NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication system configuration to a <a href="C:\display\KB\Integrating+with+EMC+DD+Boost">DD Boost storage unit Backup Repository</a> causes the DD Boost storage unit to be unmounted. Therefore, to avoid re-adding the DD Boost storage as an existing Backup Repository manually, exclude DD Boost storage unit repositories from the list of repositories for self-backup.</p>
