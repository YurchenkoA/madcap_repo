        <h1>Replication Job Wizard for Hyper-V: Source</h1>
        <p>On the <b>Source </b>page in the wizard, you can add Hyper-V items to your replication using one of the inventory views. Proceed as described in these sections:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_2"><a href="file:///C:/Users/User/Downloads/Replication+Job+Wizard+for+Hyper-V_+Source.doc#ReplicationJobWizardforHyper-V:Source-H">Host and Clusters</a>

        <h2>Host and Clusters</h2>
        <p>When the <b>Host &amp; Clusters</b> view is selected, the inventory tree opens in the left pane and shows you all Hyper-V items: servers, clusters, and VMs. Proceed as follows:</p>
        <ol start="1" class="ol_1">
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_2">Optionally, you can filter the inventory tree by entering a string into the <b>Search</b> box. You can enter a part of or the entire name of the item.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_2">Select Hyper-V items by selecting the checkbox next to the item.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_2">The selected items appear in the right pane of the page. You can reorder the selected items by dragging a VM or a container with the pointer to a new position. By doing that, you can specify to replicate the most important VMs first.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_2">Review the list of selected Hyper-V items. You can remove a selected VM or a container from the replication job in one of the following ways: </p>
                <ul class="ul_2">
                    <li class="li_1">
                        <p class="p_2">Deselect the item in the left pane. This will remove the item from the right pane.</p>

                    <li class="li_1">
                        <p class="p_2">In the right pane, hover the pointer over the item you want to remove and click the red “x” on the right. This will deselect the item in the left pane.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        </ol>
        <h2>Jobs and Groups</h2>
        <p>When the <b>Jobs &amp; Groups</b> view is selected, the inventory tree shows groups, jobs, and backups of the appropriate hypervisor. Proceed as described for the <b>Hosts &amp; Clusters</b> view above.<br /><span class="span_1"><br /><img src="../../Resources/Images/Replication+Job+Wizard+for+Hyper-V_+Source/Replication Job Wizard for_6_4.png" class="img_24" /></span></p>
        <h2>Backup Repositories</h2>
        <p>When the <b>Backup Repositories</b> view is selected, the inventory tree shows the Backup Repositories that contain backups of the appropriate hypervisor.

        <h2>Policy</h2>
        <p><span class="span_3">When the </span><b class="b_2">Policy</b><span class="span_3"> view is selected, job policies can be used. Refer to&#160;</span><a href="C:\display\NH\Managing+Job+Policies"><span class="span_3">Managing&#160;</span>Job Policies</a><span class="span_3">&#160;for details. If the items were selected in alternate views, a dialog box opens warning you that switching to the&#160;</span><b>Policy&#160;</b><span class="span_3">view will reset your current selection.
