        <h1>Replication Job Wizard for Amazon EC2: Source</h1>
        <p>On the <b>Source </b>page of the wizard, you can add EC2 items to your replication job. Proceed as follows:</p>
        <ol class="ol_1">
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_1"><span class="span_3">1. </span>In the left pane of the page, select one of the&#160;following <a href="C:\display\NH\Inventory">inventory</a> views:</p>

                    <li class="li_1">

                            <li class="li_1">
                                <p class="p_1"><span class="span_3">1. </span>Optionally, you can filter the inventory tree by entering a string into the <b>Search</b> box. You can enter a part of or the entire name of the item.</p>
