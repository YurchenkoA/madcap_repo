        <h1>Granting Self-Service Access</h1>
        <p>In the multi-tenant mode, you can provide tenants with access to their dashboards. By default, a tenant admin account is automatically created when you create a new tenant. The tenant admin has full control over the product features inside the tenant dashboard (such as edit and update tenant inventory, Transporters, and Backup Repositories, and create and manage jobs and groups). For each tenant, one guest account can also be created. The tenant guest has limited permissions inside the tenant and can only generate job and group reports by default. To provide a tenant with access to the self-service interface, send the following information to the tenant:</p>
        <ul class="ul_1">
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_1">Link to NAKIVO Backup &amp; Replication Director.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_1">Tenant login.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_1">Tenant password.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
